Nate believes it is important for pets to have friends and opportunities for socialization. He arranged doggy playdates with a couple and their dog that he met while walking Max, his pet (Memory 11).\n3.

Additionally, her issue with lactose intolerance and effort to adapt with dairy-free alternatives, as well as her desire to find suitable pets despite her allergies, highlight her need to manage an overactive immune response ([Memories 1], [2], [3], [5]).
